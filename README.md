# Firearms Background Checks in 2020
This project examines firearm purchases in the United States. Data and background information is taken from Buzzfeed News ( https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks ), and further explanation can be found there.

Purchasing a firearm in the US from a licensed dealer requires a federal background check (NICS check). Some states and municipalities in the US also require
a permit for gun ownership. Of those areas, some run regular background checks on permit holders to confirm eligibility. There are various other reasons that a NICS 
check would be conducted. In this project, created a variable to examine only the NICS checks run for purchases. Since gun ownership is a polarizing political issue in the US, I kept the data grouped by state. 

Conventional wisdom and several news articles suggest that gun ownership increases during times of uncertainty, such as that experienced in 2020. ( https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/us-gun-sales-record/index.html )( https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-record-high-2020/ ). 

STEPS 1 & 2:
Building out the table and importing the .csv file.

STEP 3:
Creating a column, "total_purchase," that only includes background checks run for sales

STEP 4: 
Examine state totals for each type of firearm  purchase

STEP 5:
Examine each states estimated purchases for 2018

STEP 6:
Examine each states estimated purchases for 2020

STEPS 7 & 8: 
Compare state totals from 2018 to 2020

STEP 9:
How many monthly purchases has each state averaged since the NICS background check system was put in place?

STEP 10:
How many annual purchases has each state averaged since the NICS background check system was put in place?

STEPS 11 & 12:
How did purchases in 2020 compare to each state's average? Which states were farthest above average?

STEPS 13 & 14:
Which years have seen the most gun sales in the US? How far were those years above average?

STEPS 15 & 16:
Which months have seen the most gun sales in the US? How far were those months above average?

STEP 17:
Which three-month periods had the most gun sales? (top 5 three-month periods)

STEP 18:
What month has seen the sharpest month-over-month increase in sales volume? (top 5)

STEP 19: 
What month has seen the sharpest month-over-month increase in sales percentage? (top 5)
