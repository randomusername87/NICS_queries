# Firearms Background Checks in 2020
This project examines firearm purchases in the United States. Data and background information is taken from Buzzfeed News ( https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks ), and further explanation can be found there.

Purchasing a firearm in the US from a licensed dealer requires a federal background check (NICS check). Some states and municipalities in the US also require
a permit for gun ownership. Of those areas, some run regular background checks on permit holders to confirm eligibility. There are various other reasons that a NICS 
check would be conducted. In this project, created a variable to examine only the NICS checks run for purchases. Since gun ownership is a polarizing political issue in the US, I kept the data grouped by state. 

Conventional wisdom and several news articles suggest that gun ownership increases during times of uncertainty, such as that experienced in 2020. ( https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/us-gun-sales-record/index.html )( https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-record-high-2020/ ). 

STEPS 1 & 2:
Building out the table and importing the .csv file.

STEP 3:
Creating a column, "total_purchase," that only includes background checks run for sales

STEPS 4 & 5: 
Examining the number NICS run for purchases in 2018 and 2020 by state.

STEP 5:
Examining the difference in NICS run for purchases in 2018 and 2020 by state.

STEP 6: 
Examining the % difference in NICS run for purchases in 2018 and 2020 by state.

STEP 7:
Finding the average monthly NICS run for purchases in each state.

STEP 8:
Finding the average yearly NICS run for purchases in each state (to use as a new baseline).

STEP 9: 
Comparing each states 2020 NICS run for purchases with their average.

STEP 10: 
Finding the months with the highest month-to-month increase in NICS run for purchases

STEP 11: 
Comparing each state's monthly average NICS run for purchases with that of the months identified in the previous step.
